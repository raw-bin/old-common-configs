common-configs
==============

This is a collection of configurations for essential tools that I use
across all my machines.

The idea is to clone this directory to some suitable location and then
symlink the relevant config files over. The configs are _very_
personalised to my tastes and do use plugins that I like.

At present, the following items are covered:

1. vim
